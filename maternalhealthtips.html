Pregnancy and motherhood is a beautiful journey in a woman's life. A woman must take proper care of her health during her pregnancy
 so that both the mother and the child remain healthy pre and post-delivery. Here are a few solutions to common problems that women
 face during their pregnancy. The solutions are mostly based on diet changes. It is highly advised that you consult your doctor 
if your problem persists for a long period of time.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.731IM7WEdvq0VPfxzj43UQHaE9?w=265&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.3&pid=1.7"></p>
<p>High blood pressure and pregnancy aren’t necessarily a dangerous combination. But having hypertension during pregnancy requires 
special care, irrespective of whether you are diagnosed with this problem before or after conception.
High blood pressure, medically known as hypertension, means the force of the blood that pushes against the walls of your arteries 
is too high. Blood pressure readings of 140/90 mm Hg are considered too high. The solutions to this problem are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Avoid salt and high-sodium foods ( these mainly include processed foods and snacks)
<li>
Practice Deep Breathing which helps in lowering stress
<li>
Walk and exercise regularly ( you can do light exercises and practice yoga)
<li>
Add potassium-rich foods in your diet for example: sweet potatoes, tomatoes, kidney beans, orange juice, bananas, peas, potatoes, dried fruits, melon and cantaloupe. 
<li>
Keep a check on your weight
</ul>
<li>

<p style="text-align:left;"><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.Rt08v6HC-oo9A2fAsh3dhQHaFj?w=180&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.3&pid=1.7"></p>
<p>Experiencing fast heartbeats during pregnancy is not uncommon. A heart rate reaching up 
to 100 bpm (beats per minute) or above may be normal for most people. However, during pregnancy, the heart rate may increase
 by about 25%. This increase in heart rate may cause episodic heart palpitations in pregnant women.Although an increased heartbeat
 is a normal physiological process, you might adapt to some lifestyle changes to keep your health, and your baby’s in check. Few of the 
lifestyle changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Try to stay calm and beat stress by occasional intake of chamomile tea or aromatherapy.
<li>
Get enough sleep at night regularly, and ensure it is undisturbed.
<li>
Practice relaxation techniques, such as yoga, deep breathing, and meditation.
<li>
Drink enough water to remain well-hydrated.
 </ul>
<li>

<p>Generally, if you are pregnant and your heart rate is less than 60 beats per minute,
 your doctor should evaluate you thoroughly for any underlying cardiovascular or other medical issues. Hence, the first 
solution is to consult your doctor as early as possible. The others are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Exercise ( according to the schedule set by your doctor or dietician)
<li>
Eat a healthful diet (Proteins, fruits, vegetables, and other nourishing foods can help protect the heart)
<li>

<li>
